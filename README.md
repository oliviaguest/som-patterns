# som-patterns
A unified repo for both perceptual and phonological patterns.

This repo depends on the [semantic-features](https://github.com/oliviaguest/semantic-features) and  [phonological-features](https://github.com/oliviaguest/phonological-features) repos. They are [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). 
If you want to run any of the scripts here to regenerate stuff for yourself you will need to also grab those repos. Currently they are private.
